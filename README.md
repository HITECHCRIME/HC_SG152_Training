## Lyrics

```
INTRO

hitech crime (electronic voice, glitch, GLADOS style but with darkness)
*whistling wind, some electronic noises of the street, like buzzing electricity from neons*

"learned a lesson, your turn"

HOOK (coming up)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

CHORUS (drop)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

INTERMISSION

Wounds
Reversed the costs at the speed of flow
aye

CHORUS

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

INTERMISSION

Fear(?) in the eyes of the public
When I drop the bombs with...

CHORUS (lower chilled scream)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

VERSE

Landlines filled with blots
I slide off,  what everybody does,

....

anybody knows 
that I tend to search for costs
usually chunks of soul

CHORUS

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

blargh

OUTRO

*electric explosion - overloaded street generator with sparks hiting the pavement ;p not sure just yet, everything can be changed to fit a mutual vision*

///

With gold so thoughts bring the light from souls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer all 

```

⁣
HC_SG_R01_TRIBE IS A "PILOT EPISODE" OF HITECH CRIME CINEMATIC UNIVERSE⁣
⁣
'Tribe' release is going to be the first transmedia narrative chapter from the storyworld of Hitech Crime made by Helve AVR. ⁣
⁣
This marks the prototyping phase being actualized. Let the audiovisual experiments begin. The lyrics are not yet final as I’m yet to add some adlibs for the blanks.⁣
⁣
Both song and the whole audiovisual script for the short film release relates close to my heart as it deals with the main overarching theme that has been present in my life - the notion of belonging to a tribe. Study on the feeling of loss, loyalty, discovery, self-realization and mastery.⁣
⁣
This particular story is a paraphrase of what I went through life. I was undermining myself by trying to fit in anywhere it was possible out of despair. It is a metaphor for loyalty changes, self-destructive blind behaviour when I couldn't cope with what I was feeling, with often non-existent mind games, self-sabotage, betrayals, the deception of real life.⁣
⁣
This is going to be one song single + surrounding material release.⁣
