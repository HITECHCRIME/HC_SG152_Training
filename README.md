## Lyrics

```
INTRO

hitech crime (electronic voice, glitch, GLADOS style but with darkness)
*whistling wind, some electronic noises of the street, like buzzing electricity from neons*

"learned a lesson, your turn"

HOOK (coming up)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

CHORUS (drop)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

INTERMISSION

Wounds
Reversed the costs at the speed of flow
aye

CHORUS

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

INTERMISSION

Fear(?) in the eyes of the public
When I drop the bombs with...

CHORUS (lower chilled scream)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

VERSE

Landlines filled with blots
I slide off,  what everybody does,

....

anybody knows 
that I tend to search for costs
usually chunks of soul

CHORUS

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

blargh

OUTRO

*electric explosion - overloaded street generator with sparks hiting the pavement ;p not sure just yet, everything can be changed to fit a mutual vision*

///

With gold so thoughts bring the light from souls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer all 

```
